        <p><span class="highlight">DJDada</span> — a guy who's still figuring things out and sometimes struggles to get it all done, but always curious and driven by his interests (in weird things).</p>
        
        <p>-> tends to have quick reflexes and rapid responses—by default act spontaneously on whatever idea comes to me, which fuels my creativity but sometimes results in glitches or hiccups along the way.</p>
        
        <p>I'm always frank and straightforward. According to ppl's pov I'm unpredictable and I feel that's a pretty noice talent.</p>
        
        <p>Communication is not my cup of tea, and social anxiety makes expressing myself with words even harder. I don't care about it—this is just how I am.</p>
        
        <p>Ever since I was a kid, I've been curious about how things work, even if I don't know the names or technical words, I just want to understand how they function.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            <span class="quote-text">You must not care about what things are; you must know what they do.</span>
            <span class="quote-author">— Randall Munroe</span>
        </div>
        
        <p>So basically I'm not really into theory—I prefer creating things, building applications, and bringing ideas to life through visualization. I'm a GUI guy by default; if something isn't crafted well enough visually, it's hard for me to render it and that's a compatibility issue then. My imagination is incredibly vivid and precise, crazily synchronised irl so perfectly melds with reality that my ideas don't feel like fantasy, it's just like AR but some kind of integrated in my systum by default.</p>
        
        <p>On the tech side, I've built several IoT projects — including one that controls a fan through voice commands. Although dealing with the main electrical connection can be dangerous but I'm someone who likes to take risks.</p>
        
        <p>I love driving and riding, and I'm eager to learn drifting soon—or maybe I've already started, you never know. I enjoy adventure, thrill, and challenging tasks.</p>
