        <h1>About <span class="accent">DJDada</span></h1>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Hey, I'm djdada</span> — a guy who's still figuring things out and sometimes struggles to get it all done, but always curious and driven by my interests.</p>
        
        <p>I tend to have <span class="highlight">quick reflexes and rapid responses</span>—I usually act spontaneously on whatever idea comes to me, which fuels my creativity but sometimes results in glitches or hiccups along the way.</p>
        
        <p>I'm always <span class="highlight">frank and straightforward</span>. Many people I've met have described me as unpredictable—something I've come to accept as part of who I am.</p>
        
        <p><span class="highlight">Communication is tough for me</span>, and social anxiety makes expressing myself with words even harder. I don't bother sugarcoating it—this is just how I am.</p>
        
        <p>Since childhood, I've been <span class="highlight">curious about how things work</span> and what makes them tick. I'm not always great with names or technical terms, but I deeply want to understand how things function.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not really into theory—I prefer <span class="highlight">creating things, building applications, and bringing ideas to life through visualization</span>. I'm a GUI guy at heart; if something isn't crafted well enough visually, it's hard for me to connect with it. My imagination is incredibly vivid and precise, syncing so perfectly with reality that my ideas don't feel like fantasy—they feel tangible and achievable.</p>
        
        <p>On the tech side, I've built <span class="highlight">several IoT projects</span> — including one that controls a fan through voice commands. Although dealing with the main electrical connection can be dangerous, I'm someone who likes to take risks.</p>
        
        <p>I also <span class="highlight">love driving</span> and yearn to learn drifting, which I plan to start soon.</p>
